# SAFPython Constructor
***
### Overview
SAFPython Constructor is a successor to [SAFBuilder](https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/SAFBuilder "SAFBuilder"), created by Zyad Ahmed for UMBC's Software Engineering graduate program capstone project. This project was sponsored by UMBC's dedicated library.

I have also utilized some code from [PySAF](https://github.com/cstarcher/pysaf) which was altered and is properly credited in the related code block's comments.


### Instructions
1. Navigate to the GitHub page: [SAFPython Constructor](https://github.com/zahmed3/SAFPython_Constructor)

2. Click on the Releases Tab on the side of the page; I will provide a hyperlink in case you are not able to see it: [Releases](https://github.com/zahmed3/SAFPython_Constructor/releases/tag/v1)

3. Look under Assets and click on SAFPython_Constructor.exe to download the application.

4. After installing, simply double click on the downloaded SAFPython_Constructor.exe file to open the application. It will say that the file is unverified and give you a warning when trying to running it, but please ignore this warning as this file does not contain anything harmful.

5. When attempting to start the operation, please make sure that the CSV file is in the same folder directory as the document files you want to archive.
